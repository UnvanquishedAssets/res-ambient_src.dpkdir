Unvanquished ambient assets
===========================


About
-----

This is a resource package providing ambient assets to the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

It's the right place to put generic sci-fi crates and humming background sounds.

This asset library is meant to be used with a level editor like [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/).

Visit the [Unvanquished website](https://unvanquished.net) for more information about the game itself.
